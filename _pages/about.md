I am currently an Assistand Professor the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada. My research interests include GIScience, Social Network Analysis, OpenStreetMap, and Biodiversity Conservation. I am also enthusiastic about questions regarding how and why to teach, or more generally about the the role of education in society.

Prior to joining Carleton I was a Lecturer at National University of Singapore and University College Cork, Ireland. I have a PhD. form McGill University, BSc. in Computer Science, and MSc. in Geoinformatics ftom Calcutta University and Symbiosis International University respectively.

When I am not running between classes and office, I enjoy playing football (soccer!?).

As an educator and mentor, I beleive that the best output is produced by happy people in supportive, inclusive, and diverse environments. Consequently, I strive to provide an environment where everyone is welcome irrespective of their gender, sexual orientation, social background, or disabilities. The best people to work with are the one's who are excited about challenges, willing to try out many, often out-of-the-box approaches, and are able to reflect on the winding path that led to the solution. All of these qualities are of course in addition to being a person one would like to hangout with!
