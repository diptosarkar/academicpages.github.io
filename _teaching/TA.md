### Student Comments
* Submission #1206684: Best TA I've ever had. Very approachable in class, with informative responses to questions, as well as willing to stay over his required hour for some labs if needed. He also has great information about GIS in the real world, as well as additional information not covered in the labs for GIS to help. A fair grader, and responds to emails relatively quickly with helpful answers to my questions. 5 stars *****
