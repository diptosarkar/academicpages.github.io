### Student Comments
* Submission #1206684: Best TA I've ever had. Very approachable in class, with informative responses to questions, as well as willing to stay over his required hour for some labs if needed. He also has great information about GIS in the real world, as well as additional information not covered in the labs for GIS to help. A fair grader, and responds to emails relatively quickly with helpful answers to my questions. 5 stars *****

### Student Comments
* Submission #1099749: Highly approachable and friendly. Very helpful and retains a balance between helping and letting you figure things out on your own ie doesn't spoon-feed, but guides you in the right direction. Is very knowledgeable about the subject.
* Submission #1102586: Super nice, patient and helpful.
* Submission #1116347: Describes things well enough, but I feel he lacks in explaining things clearly.
* Submission #1116798: Dipto Sarkar was the best! Camille at times is difficult to work with, impatient
* Submission #1117856: Dipto is caring, patient, and knowledgeable. Everyone in my lab was excited to have him as the TA for the day, as he was willing to help with problems and seemed happy to be there, which was a nice change from the 8:30am grogginess every other TA I've ever had at McGill has demonstrated. He even stayed overtime helping people, something that the other lab TA was not willing to do! Dipto is a great TA and I hope he TAs the GIS classes next semester.
* Submission #1137180: Sarkar usually went above and beyond what he was told to do by the professors, including staying past his allotted time to help with questions. Sometimes it was frustrating as we could tell he had been told not to answer specific questions about the assignments, but overall he actually cared and wanted to help students learn.
* Submission #1140361: Very willing to help
