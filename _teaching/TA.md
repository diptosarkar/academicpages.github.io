var ctx = document.getElementById("myChart2").getContext('2d');
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'horizontalBar',
    data: {
        labels: ["Excellent", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"],
        datasets: [{
            label: '# of Votes',
            data: [11, 0, 2, 0, 0],
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(200, 200, 200, 0.8)',
            borderColor: 'rgba(200, 200, 200, 1)',
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
